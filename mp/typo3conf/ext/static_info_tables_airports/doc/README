Airport location database                  11th February, 2002
--------------------------------------------------------------

This SQL table of little more than 8000 airports around the
world has been compiled from various sources on the Internet.
I believe I've had to do a sufficient amount of my own work
and data mangling to call this my own.

Each table row contains 
 - The airport's three-letter IATA code
 - A two-letter ISO country code
 - Latitude and longitude (as doubles)
 - A display name for the airport

Note that the locations in this database do differ from
those used by airlines in mileage calculations etc. Usually
this is because the data in this table is more accurate.
If you want to approximate airline data, start stripping
least significant digits from our data until the figures
look similar. The other option is to buy the official
Location ID codes from IATA; an annual subscription to the
data is $2,190.00 (USD).

This table and the data in it is believed to be in the public
domain. If you'd like to submit changes or updates, feel
free to drop me a line at karppinen@pobox.com.
